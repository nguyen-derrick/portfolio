# About Me

## Hey, I'm Derrick
I've worked across industries like finance, automation, and cloud solutions at companies including Manulife, CIBC, Scotiabank, Ripple, and Veeam. With a strong foundation in data engineering, analytics, and business intelligence, I focus on creating systems that solve real-world problems and improve efficiency.

## Outside of Work
I'm passionate about staying active and exploring new places. I enjoy hiking, collecting magnets from the cities I visit, trying out new restaurants, and experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. I'm also a sports enthusiast, always up for a game.
